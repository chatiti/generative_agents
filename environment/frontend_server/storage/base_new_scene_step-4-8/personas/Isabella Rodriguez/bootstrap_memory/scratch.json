For the survey design, I used well-established and validated questionnaires that have been used in previous research studies. These questionnaires have shown high reliability and validity in measuring the constructs of interest. Additionally, I conducted a pilot study with a small group of participants to test the survey's clarity and understandability. Based on their feedback, I made some minor revisions to improve the survey's effectiveness. As for ensuring the reliability and validity of the data, I employed various strategies such as conducting tests for internal consistency, using appropriate statistical analyses, and cross-checking the findings with qualitative data from interviews. By employing these rigorous measures, I aimed to ensure the accuracy and credibility of the data collected."
